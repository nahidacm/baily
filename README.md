baily
=====

A simple CMS based on Zend Framework

For sack of small repo size, The ZEND Library is excluded, before running this, must need the ZEND library in library/ directory

DB Dump with sample data is shipped with named "baily.sql"

good practice is, create an sub-domain instead of keeping them simply in a sub-folder
